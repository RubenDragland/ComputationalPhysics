# TFY4235 Computational Physics
Jupyter notebooks and scripts with code examples, as shown in the lectures of
TFY4235 Computational Physics at NTNU, spring 2016 (and again in the spring of
2021). The examples are shown in class as part of the lectures, and with
supporting material. They are not intended to be completely stand-alone or
self-explanatory.

## Notebooks
The jupyter notebooks in the Notebooks folder will be presented in class, in the
order as they are numbered. The notebooks in the subfolder 2016 were shown in
class in 2016, and will be updated and expanded a bit as we go along.
